precision and recall

True class A (TA) - correctly classified into class A
False class A (FA) - incorrectly classified into class A
True class B (TB) - correctly classified into class B
False class B (FB) - incorrectly classified into class B

precision = TA / (TA + FA)
recall = TA / (TA + FB)

You might also need accuracy and F-measure:

accuracy = (TA + TB) / (TA + TB + FA + FB)
f-measure = 2 * ((precision * recall)/(precision + recall))
